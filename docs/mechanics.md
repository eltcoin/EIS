reputation is generated by parties by doing actions that are subjectively "good"
the subjectivity of the actions are determined by the participants themselves

compared to systems such as:
- Circle
- BrightID

the reputation computation scales without manual curation of groups and memberships

the cost of attacking the group / subverting the reputation metric scales (SOMETHING)ALLY as there are more connections between nodes



can I lookup events within smart contracts ?
