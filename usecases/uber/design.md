people interact and each party receives trust
trust is evidence of reputability
the algorithm converges the evidence into a matrix of reputation

then that reputation matrix is used to govern this loop of how people obtain more trust

ie.



trust can then be used as a governance mechanism

### replicating uber
initial reputation is established by reputable guarantor

drivers:
    the org who authenticates that people have got good licensing
    the org that checks the car is correct
riders:
    the org that checks the driver hasn't been banned before
    the org that checks the background of the driver

riders and drivers then give each other ratings

the dapp market then performs the following:
ranks orders between two pairs
(ride, drive) (drive, ride)

ranks by the reputation score of both

if the reputation of a rider or driver is less than a system minimum
then they cannot be matched

ie. 
rider_rep < minimum_rider_rep
driver < minimum_driver_rep
